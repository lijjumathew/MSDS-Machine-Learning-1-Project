    "Customer churn has many definitions: customer attrition, customer turnover, customer defection, etc. They all refer to tge loss of customers which can be by choice (voluntary) or relocation (involuntary). Our team's goal is to predict which customers are at risk of churning. Our analysis helps the Telco company design activities and create strategies to retain customers, their main asset, and minimize churn. The Telco Customer Churn dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churnIn). The dataset has 7,043 entries (customers) and 21 attributes that capture information such as demographics and customer relationship history. All customer entries contain several features and an attribute stating if the customer has churned or not. To better understand the data we will first load it into the pandas package and explore it with the help of some basic commands."
